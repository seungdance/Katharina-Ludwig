            DOUBLE STANDARDS is a longing for connection. An artistic collaboration to revive an old friendship by exploring personal
            standards through the language of dance and theatre. Vanessa and Katharina are meeting again after having shared two intense
            years of dance education, that made them once inseparable - 7 years ago. After following their own paths, they are now
            negotiating their different expectations of life, career, and friendship. DOUBLE STANDARDS embraces radical honesty, artificial
            appearances, contradicting tastes, false promises and true connection - with the aim to find a common (dance) language again.

            <p>
              V and K love to dance.
              <br />
              V and K met at dance university in 2016.
              <br />
              V and K studied dance together until 2018.
              <br />
              V and K are the exact same height (175 cm).
              <br />
              V and K both play the violin (relatively bad).
              <br />
              V has dark skin and curly long black hair.
              <br />
              K has light skin and straight long blond hair.
              <br />
              V parle Français.
              <br />
              K spricht Deutsch.
              <br />
              Together they speak English.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="story-column">
            <p>
              K loves humorous dance pieces.
              <br />
              V loves serious dance pieces.
              <br />
              V doesn't eat sugar. K doesn't eat meat.
              <br />
              V and K share the same childish humor.
              <br />
              After university, V left to Spain.
              <br />
              K stayed in Germany.
              <br />
              K could have gone to Spain, too.
              <br />
              But K went to study and work in different countries.
            </p>

          <div class="story-column">
            <p>
              V sometimes wonders what would have been, if K came to Spain.
              <br />
              Now V lives in Lausanne.
              <br />
              K now lives in Bern.
              <br />
              K spent weekends with V's family in Switzerland while V was abroad.
              <br />
              V and K both had a meniscus tear this year.
              <br />
              V got surgery. K didn't.
              <br />
              V is a mess with WhatsApp messages. She sometimes doesn't answer for moths.
              <br />
              K accepted it.
              <br />
              K is also a mess sometimes.
              <br />
              V calls K Katastrophe.
              <br />
              K calls V Vanessos.
            </p>

          <div class="story-column">
            <p>
              V and K pursued different dance careers.
              <br />
              V and K were best friends.
              <br />
              V and K want to reconnect.
              <br />
              Through dance. Through their friendship. And through humor.
