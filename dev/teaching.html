              Katharina's contemporary dance training combines fixed movement sequences with improvisation exercises based on contemporary
              technique and floorwork. After a warm-up that builds the dancers' strength and endurance, the training progresses to floor
              work. Afterwards, the dancers move through the space, standing or on the floor, with sequences that combine flowing movements
              with powerful, dynamic elements. In addition to its physicality, the class is based on play, groove and the joy of movement.
              An emphasis lies on establishing a connection between dance and music. Through different rhythmic exercises the training
              playfully expands the dancer's own movement vocabulary. The class offers a variety of dance material that moves the body as a
              whole and encourages the dancers to deepen both their technical skills as well as their artistic expressiveness.
